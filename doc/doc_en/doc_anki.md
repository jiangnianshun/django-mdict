2. Keep Anki running in the background. Check the button bar at the bottom of this page and the Add Card button will appear. Copy the content to the front and back of the card, then select the deck and click the Add Cards to button to create the card.

The front side of the card can only be pasted as plain text, and the back side of the card can be pasted as plain text or styled text.

Automatic copy: Automatically copy the prefix of the currently expanded entry to the front of the card without style, and copy the content of the currently expanded entry to the back of the card with style. There is unexpanded content in the entry when copying, and it cannot be expanded after copying. If the HTML structure is complex, copying will take a long time.

Manual copy: Manually select the content to copy. When pasting, ctrl+v is to paste with style, ctrl+shift+v is to paste as plain text, or right-click the mouse and select paste or paste as plain text, and then long press on the mobile phone to bring up the right-mouse button.

Copying with styles will lose some styles. And it can only display online images, and does not support the insertion of images and audio. Anki does not support the display of base64 images. It cannot be used in browsers that do not support ckeditor5 (cefpython cannot be used).
